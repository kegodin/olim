* Optimization Todo
  1. [X] Fix the bugs
  2. [ ] Add direct solve for non-bv
  3. [ ] Convert to SOA
  4. [ ] Split fac and non-fac update functions
  5. [ ] Lag mults
     - [ ] Add initial lambda argument
     - [ ] Warm start using triangle update arglam
     - [ ] Check lagmults inside of tetra
  6. [ ] Pass in precomputed stuff to tri and tetra
     - [ ] TODO at cost_funcs.hpp:233
  7. [ ] Add command-line arguments to Python plotting scripts
  8. [ ] Make plots and ensure that they agree with old results
  9. [ ] Try to get olim6_rhr to run as fast as basic_marcher_3d
     (close gap)
  10. [ ] Remove STL headers
  11. [ ] Remove macros
      - [ ] P*** macros -> b'***' literals
  12. [ ] Speed up tests
      - Try different test library?
        - cgreen seemed fine and was written in C
  13. [ ] Try disabling exceptions
  14. [ ] Replace malloc and news with "operator new" (minimum number
      of includes and no unnecessary calling of ctors via new)
  15. [ ] Global p_fac -> pf
  16. [ ] Global s_fac -> sf
  17. [ ] Try making mp0's `eval' mp1's `eval' to see if that fixes
      the symmetry problem
