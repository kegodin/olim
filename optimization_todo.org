* Optimization Todo
  1. [X] Fix the bugs
  2. [X] Add direct solve for non-bv
  3. [ ] Can move some stuff in numopt.hpp into numopt.cpp
  4. [X] Correctly set lambda in tri_bv for one-point updates
  5. [ ] Getting to the point where probably the simplest thing is to
     just delete the "update" classes and move everything into the
     olim & olim3d classes as member functions...
  6. [ ] Use Theorem 3.7 to evaluate instead of Theorem 3.6
  7. [ ] Convert to SOA
  8. [ ] Split fac and non-fac update functions
  9. [ ] Lag mults
     - [ ] Add initial lambda argument
     - [ ] Warm start using triangle update arglam
     - [ ] Check lagmults inside of tetra
  10. [ ] Pass in precomputed stuff to tetra
      - [ ] TODO at cost_funcs.hpp:233
  11. [X] Add command-line arguments to Python plotting scripts
  12. [ ] Make plots and ensure that they agree with old results
  13. [ ] Try to get olim6_rhr to run as fast as basic_marcher_3d
      - currently pretty damn close... olim6_rhr is about 15% slower
  14. [ ] Remove STL headers
  15. [ ] Remove macros
      - [ ] P*** macros -> b'***' literals
  16. [ ] Speed up tests
      - Try different test library?
        - cgreen seemed fine and was written in C
  17. [ ] Try disabling exceptions
  18. [ ] Replace malloc and news with "operator new" (minimum number
      of includes and no unnecessary calling of ctors via new)
  19. [ ] Global p_fac -> pf
  20. [ ] Global s_fac -> sf
  21. [ ] Try making mp0's `eval' mp1's `eval' to see if that fixes
      the symmetry problem
  22. [ ] Remove `in_bounds' check by using a (n+2)^3 grid---this
      actually does appear to take a significant amount of time...
  23. [ ] Reduce branching by replacing "if (nb[i]) {...}" with a
      precomputed array of indices to valid neighbors
  24. [ ] Replace pybind11 with Cython
  25. [ ] Use templates to remove macros from updates.tri
