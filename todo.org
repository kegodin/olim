* Optimization Todo
  1. [ ] Getting to the point where probably the simplest thing is to
     just delete the "update" classes and move everything into the
     olim & olim3d classes as member functions...
  2. [ ] Since triangle updates are so much cheaper than SQP updates,
     a better approach to solving unconstrained optimization problems
     might be to implement the following constrained algorithm:
     1) Do each triangle update + lagmults & skipping
     2) Do interior solve only if the above fails
     3) Could try a regular old Newton iteration for the interior solve...
     If we did this, we wouldn't need to do the fussy triangle
     skipping when we use the direct solver: we would only use it for
     the interior point case, since after solving the three triangle
     updates, we would know definitively if the optimum is in the
     interior
  3. [ ] The octant optimization is worth doing: without it, we end up
     wasting time accessing `inds' and checking if the indices are
     equal to `parent'
  4. [ ] Optimize memory to the point that we can run 1025^3 jobs on a
     computer with 64GB of memory
  5. [ ] Use Theorem 3.7 to evaluate instead of Theorem 3.6?
  6. [ ] Remove `in_bounds' check by using a (n+2)^3 grid---this
     actually does appear to take a significant amount of time...
     - [ ] Add a "barrier" state and just set the boundary to
       "barrier" to implement this without having to think too hard
       about it
  7. [ ] Reduce branching by replacing "if (nb[i]) {...}" with a
     precomputed array of indices to valid neighbors
  8. [ ] Convert to SOA
  9. [ ] Split fac and non-fac update functions
  10. [ ] Re-enable skipping and see if we can get any speedup
  11. [ ] Lag mults
      - [ ] Add initial lambda argument
      - [ ] Warm start using triangle update arglam
      - [ ] Check lagmults inside of tetra
  12. [ ] Make plots and ensure that they agree with old results
  13. [ ] Try to get olim6_rhr to run as fast as basic_marcher_3d
      - currently pretty damn close... olim6_rhr is about 15% slower
  14. [ ] Remove STL headers
  15. [ ] Remove macros
      - [ ] P*** macros -> b'***' literals
  16. [ ] Speed up tests
      - Try different test library?
        - cgreen seemed fine and was written in C
  17. [ ] Try disabling exceptions
  18. [ ] Replace `malloc' and `new's with "operator new" (minimum
      number of includes and no unnecessary calling of ctors via new)
  19. [ ] Global p_fac -> pf
  20. [ ] Global s_fac -> sf
  21. [ ] Replace pybind11 with Cython
  22. [ ] Use templates to remove macros from updates.tri
  23. [X] Fix the bugs
  24. [X] Add direct solve for non-bv
  25. [X] Correctly set lambda in tri_bv for one-point updates
  26. [X] Add command-line arguments to Python plotting scripts
  27. [X] Try making mp0's `eval' mp1's `eval' to see if that fixes
      the symmetry problem
      - symmetry problem fixed by switching to direct solve! probably
        the reason this was happening was because we were minimizing a
        surrogate function
