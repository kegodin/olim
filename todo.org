* <2019-01-22 Tue>
  1. [X] SoA task

* General refactoring
  1. [X] Remove all instances of EIKONAL and replace with OLIM
  2. [X] Add vector class
  3. [ ] Simplify updates.tri.hpp... It's way more complicated than it
     needs to be... 330 lines where it should be around 100-150
  4. [ ] Collapse marcher and marcher_3d into one class
  5. [ ] Some renaming
     - [ ] olim -> olim2
     - [ ] olim3d -> olim3
     - [ ] basic_marcher -> fmm2
     - [ ] basic_marcher_3d -> fmm3
  6. [X] speed -> slowness
  7. [ ] get_value -> get_U
  8. [X] T -> U everwhere
  9. [ ] Add T = template parameter for double/float
  10. [ ] Distinguish between indices
      - [ ] Add a `handle' type to distinguish the location of a node
        in the grid
      - [ ] Add a neighborhood index type to distinguish the location
        of a node in a neighborhood
  11. [ ] Remove second argument from `sqp_bary': i.e., use only one
      `x' argument which contains the initial iterate to begin and is
      overwritten with the optimum at the end. When we do this, we can
      also:
      - [ ] Have `sqp_bary' return its error code in an enum
      - [ ] Just take the updates::info<d> struct as a reference
        instead of separate parameters
  12. [ ] Don't actually need to store qr_wkspc in cost_functor...
  13. [ ] Reduce line count in tests using generic lambdas...
  14. [ ] Remove STL headers
  15. [ ] Remove macros
      - [ ] P*** macros -> b'***' literals
  16. [ ] Global p_fac -> pf
  17. [ ] Global s_fac -> sf

* General optimization
  1. [ ] The octant optimization is worth doing: without it, we end up
     wasting time accessing `inds' and checking if the indices are
     equal to `parent'
  2. [ ] Remove `in_bounds' check by using a (n+2)^3 grid---this
     Actually does appear to take a significant amount of time...
     - [ ] Add a "barrier" state and just set the boundary to
       "barrier" to implement this without having to think too hard
       about it
  3. [ ] Reduce branching by replacing "if (nb[i]) {...}" with a
     precomputed array of indices to valid neighbors
  4. [ ] Split fac and non-fac update functions
  5. [ ] Try to get olim6_rhr to run as fast as basic_marcher_3d
     - currently pretty damn close... olim6_rhr is about 15% slower
  6. [ ] Speed up tests
     - [ ] switch to cgreen
     - [ ] unity build
  7. [ ] Try disabling exceptions
  8. [ ] Replace `malloc' and `new's with "operator new" (minimum
     number of includes and no unnecessary calling of ctors via new)

* Interface/FFI improvements
  1. [ ] Replace pybind11 with Cython
  2. [ ] Add a MATLAB interface
  3. [ ] Add a Julia interface

* Memory optimization
  1. [X] decrease size of state to a char
  2. [ ] value = 4/8 bytes (float/double)
  3. [ ] heap_pos = 2/4 bytes
  4. [ ] Optimize memory to the point that we can run 1025^3 jobs on a
     computer with 64GB of memory
  5. [X] Convert to SOA

* Remove `update' classes
  1. [ ] Getting to the point where probably the simplest thing is to
     just delete the "update" classes and move everything into the
     olim & olim3d classes as member functions...

* Numerical ideas
  1. [ ] Since triangle updates are so much cheaper than SQP updates,
     a better approach to solving unconstrained optimization problems
     might be to implement the following constrained algorithm:
     1) Do each triangle update + lagmults & skipping
     2) Do interior solve only if the above fails
     3) Could try a regular old Newton iteration for the interior solve...
     If we did this, we wouldn't need to do the fussy triangle
     skipping when we use the direct solver: we would only use it for
     the interior point case, since after solving the three triangle
     updates, we would know definitively if the optimum is in the
     interior
  2. [ ] Re-enable skipping and see if we can get any speedup
  3. [ ] Lag mults
     - [ ] Add initial lambda argument
     - [ ] Warm start using triangle update arglam
     - [ ] Check lagmults inside of tetra
