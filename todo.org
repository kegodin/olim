  - [X] Check that plots are fixed
  - [X] Fix plotting on tessier (just run in ipython for now)
  - [ ] Run larger plot job on tessier
  - [ ] Get stats working again
  - [ ] Use stats as baseline to see where we're at with skipping
  - [ ] Run basic vs. olim6 on armitage & tessier

* Optimization Todo
  1. [ ] Getting to the point where probably the simplest thing is to
     just delete the "update" classes and move everything into the
     olim & olim3d classes as member functions...
  2. [ ] Optimize memory to the point that we can run 1025^3 jobs on a
     computer with 64GB of memory
  3. [ ] Use Theorem 3.7 to evaluate instead of Theorem 3.6?
  4. [ ] Remove `in_bounds' check by using a (n+2)^3 grid---this
     actually does appear to take a significant amount of time...
  5. [ ] Reduce branching by replacing "if (nb[i]) {...}" with a
     precomputed array of indices to valid neighbors
  6. [ ] Convert to SOA
  7. [ ] Split fac and non-fac update functions
  8. [ ] Re-enable skipping and see if we can get any speedup
  9. [ ] Lag mults
     - [ ] Add initial lambda argument
     - [ ] Warm start using triangle update arglam
     - [ ] Check lagmults inside of tetra
  10. [ ] Make plots and ensure that they agree with old results
  11. [ ] Try to get olim6_rhr to run as fast as basic_marcher_3d
      - currently pretty damn close... olim6_rhr is about 15% slower
  12. [ ] Remove STL headers
  13. [ ] Remove macros
      - [ ] P*** macros -> b'***' literals
  14. [ ] Speed up tests
      - Try different test library?
        - cgreen seemed fine and was written in C
  15. [ ] Try disabling exceptions
  16. [ ] Replace `malloc' and `new's with "operator new" (minimum
      number of includes and no unnecessary calling of ctors via new)
  17. [ ] Global p_fac -> pf
  18. [ ] Global s_fac -> sf
  19. [ ] Replace pybind11 with Cython
  20. [ ] Use templates to remove macros from updates.tri
  21. [X] Fix the bugs
  22. [X] Add direct solve for non-bv
  23. [X] Correctly set lambda in tri_bv for one-point updates
  24. [X] Add command-line arguments to Python plotting scripts
  25. [X] Try making mp0's `eval' mp1's `eval' to see if that fixes
      the symmetry problem
      - symmetry problem fixed by switching to direct solve! probably
        the reason this was happening was because we were minimizing a
        surrogate function
