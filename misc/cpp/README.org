* Miscellaneous C++ files

  This directory contains a few miscellaneous C++ files. One file,
  ~scratch.cpp~, is just a convenience scratch file. If
  ~-DBUILD_SCRATCH=ON~ is passed to CMake, then it will be built, and
  can be used for quickly testing ideas out.

  The other file, ~gen_stats.cpp~, is used by one of the plotting
  scripts to generate and write the statistics collected when
  ~-DCOLLECT_STATS=ON~ is passed to CMake.
