* Plots to add

  - Circle boundary

* Things to measure

  - [ ] number of types of updates
    - count the number of types of updates
      - # line/tri/tetra updates
      - or by degree vector (e.g. # (1, 2) tri updates vs (2, 2))
    - *caveat: count for each visit, or count total for all visits?*

  - [ ] percentage of degenerate updates (tri that's line, tetra that's line or tri...)

  - [ ] number of times each node is visited
